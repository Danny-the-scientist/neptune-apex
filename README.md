# neptune-apex
Varied control programs for my fish tank;

My saltwater tank is automated by a Neptune Apex control system and includes light, wave, main pump, element (Ca, dKh balance, Mg), and more controls, including a custom cabinet backing to hold the key components and switch/button systems. The Apex syntax is very simple, but relatively unique and not easily branched off from any one thing, though it uses single quotes for commenting and basic if statements, etc. Code is syntactically colored to Visual Basic for best readability.
